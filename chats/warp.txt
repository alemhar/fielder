lets create a new react native app 
To get started, we need to decide on a couple of things:

1. Expo or bare React Native?
◦  Expo: Easier setup, great for beginners, fewer native-config headaches. Recommended unless you know you need custom native modules.
◦  Bare React Native (CLI): More control and flexibility for native code, but more setup and maintenance.
2. TypeScript or plain JavaScript?
◦  I recommend TypeScript for almost all new projects.
3. Package manager: npm, yarn, or pnpm?
◦  If you don’t care, we can just use npm.

Answer these quickly (Expo vs bare, TS vs JS, preferred package manager), and I’ll:
•  Give you exact commands to run on Windows PowerShell.
•  Include any prerequisites checks (Node, Android Studio, etc.).
•  Optionally, guide you through the first run on Android/iOS/emulator.


lets use expo, typescript and npm. and please yes guide me on the first run on Android.



npx expo start
npm start -- --clear




the emulator is black screen, I again use the actual mobile.
