## Code Conventions
- See `WARP.md` and `docs/stacks/mobile-expo-react-native-rules.md` for main programming rules.
- Tabs for indentation, single quotes for strings, no semicolons unless required.
- Favor simple, composable modules over clever abstractions.

## Documentation Conventions
- `docs/index.md` is the main entrypoint.
- Each stack has a profile + rulebook under `docs/stacks/`.
- Domain knowledge lives under `docs/domain/`.
- Delivery/roadmap and task history live under `docs/delivery/`.
- Issues and debugging knowledge live under `docs/issues/` and `docs/troubleshooting/`.
